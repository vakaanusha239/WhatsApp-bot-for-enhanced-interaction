# WhatsApp-bot-for-enhanced-interaction

Hello everyone, 
This project is about a interactive bot development which is deployed in WhatsApp.We have used the Open Ai key for the response of the query or a message, twilio to interact with the user's WhatsApp, ngrok for the internet suffering. This project is a perfect integration of the chatbot & WhatsApp messaging app which is used the mostly now-a-days. This bot can answer the queries, reply to our messages, generates the images which are asked to generate. In the project files folder the executable files are placed. 

If we want to run the files we need to create a virtual environment and install the requirements.txt then need to run the run.py file to execute our project.Before Executing the run.py we need to connect our WhatsApp to twilio account and run ngrok at port no 5000. The both ngrok & run.py should be run parellel to receives the messages or replies for our queries. 

The output of the bot we created are attached in Video folder. Check out....!
